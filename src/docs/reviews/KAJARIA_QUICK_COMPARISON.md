## ❌ What You DON'T Have (Correctly)

These are POS features that neither you nor Kajaria have:

|-------------|--------|---------|----------|
| Shopping Cart | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Yes - B2B model |

## 🎯 What Your 23 Pages Actually Are

### **Marketing Website Features (NOT POS):**

1. **Core Business (9)** - Products, Collections, About, etc.
2. **Customer Service (5)** - Sample Request, Warranty, FAQ, etc.
3. **Tools (4)** - Calculator, Visualizer, Pattern Builder, Quiz
